    <li>3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
    
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>

<p>Alright, now that you have all the ingredients, lets get cooking!</p>

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>
    <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy casserole. Add the garlic and onion and cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, about 7 minutes. Stir in the drained black beans. Add the water to the casserole and bring to a boil over moderately high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the beans for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Add all of the meats and the dried chile and cook until the beans are tender, about 1 hour longer.</li></p>
<li>Remove the meats from the casserole and thickly slice them; discard any bones. Pick out and discard the chile. Season the beans with salt. Ladle the beans into shallow bowls and serve with the sliced meats. Pass the toasted manioc flour at the table for sprinkling over the feijoada.</p>
